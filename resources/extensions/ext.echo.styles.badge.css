/* Hide Echo's colorful little boxes indicating how many new alerts/notices

 * 1) the data is already shown on the personal tools area, and thus
 * 2) these visual indicators conflict with the above and look messy since
 *    Cavendish does not render the icons (should it? IMHO, yes. But I was
 *    unable to figure out how to get it to render the Echo icons, so this'll
 *    have to do for the time being.)
